## Notes for mentors

This workshop is designed for students to work on relatively independently. It should follow on nicely from the more mentor-led workshop done on the same day.

Since we're skipping research day in week 3, students can use this opportunity to explore and experiment, feeding back to the team at the end of the session.

Because of business development, and an otherwise busy schedule, time is unfortunately quite limited. It's therefore going to be important to make sure that students focus on the most important parts of the workshop.

I've therefore suggested 45-minutes to one hour for the initial part of the workshop (initial call to the GitHub API and getting the returned data to display on a web page) + one hour (or longer if students finish the first part sooner) to move onto one of the "challenges".

It would be great if different groups could work on different challenges!

However, if this all proves to be too challenging then the priority is that students can at least get through task 1!

Students should prepare to give a quick team / pair presentation at the end, where they report back to the group on interesting things they have learnt.

A working solution is on [GitHub pages](https://emilyb7.github.io/workshop-APIs/). **Students,** don't look at the code until you've attempted your own version!
